# C Programming Basics

This repository has solutions to basic problems in C programming.
It is a collection of simple programs to help learn the fundamental concepts of C.

## Contents

- **Basic Syntax**: Programs showing how to use input/output, variables, constants, and simple loops.  
- **Control Structures**: Examples of using `if`, `else`, `switch`, and loops like `for`, `while`, and `do-while`.  
- **Functions**: Programs that explain how to create and use functions, including examples of recursion.  
- **Arrays and Strings**: Basic operations on arrays, multi-dimensional arrays, and strings.  
- **Pointers**: Programs to understand pointers, pointer arithmetic, and using pointers with arrays and functions.  
- **Dynamic Memory Allocation (DMA)**: Examples of using `malloc`, `calloc`, `realloc`, and `free` to manage memory.  
- **File Handling**: Programs to read from and write to files, including text and binary files.  
- **Loops**: More examples of nested loops and solving problems using loops.  
- **Conditions**: Programs with complex `if-else` conditions and nested conditionals.
